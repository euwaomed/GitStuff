This is Efosa CSCI 502 M05's ReadME file.

This file is an example of a readme.txt file and something similar to what you might find included with a program or other file you download from the Internet.

Because this file is just an example, there is no need for instructions or further information. However, the typical readme.txt file should include instructions on how to install the program, problems you may encounter, where to find help, FAQ's, copyright information, etc.

I got the info on how to setup a from these site below:
